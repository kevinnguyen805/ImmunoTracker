                <h1>Welcome to our Privacy Policy</h1>
                <h3>Your privacy is critically important to us.</h3>
               

                <p>It is Immunify's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website. This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="http://www.immunify.com">www.immunify.com</a> (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "www.immunify.com"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.</p>
                <p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.</p>

                            <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
                <p>Like most website operators, Immunify collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Immunify's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Immunify's visitors use its website. From time to time, Immunify may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
                <p>Immunify also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on http://www.immunify.com blog posts. Immunify only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

                            <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
                <p>Certain visitors to Immunify's websites choose to interact with Immunify in ways that require Immunify to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Immunify gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at http://www.immunify.com to provide a username and email address.</p>

                            <h2>Security</h2>
                <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>



                            <h2>Links To External Sites</h2>
                <p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and terms and conditions of every site you visit.</p>
                <p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites, products or services.</p>


                            <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
                <p>Immunify discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Immunify's behalf or to provide services available at Immunify's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Immunify's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Immunify will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Immunify discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Immunify believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Immunify, third parties or the public at large.</p>
                <p>If you are a registered user of http://www.immunify.com and have supplied your email address, Immunify may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Immunify and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Immunify takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

                            <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
                <p>Immunify may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. Immunify may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Immunify does not disclose your personally-identifying information.</p>
